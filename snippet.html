<h2>The Explanation</h2>
<p>This snippet uses multiple tags and other features.<br>
For an in-depth look at tags in general, you can check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">W3 Schools</a>, <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/02-html/">Don't Fear the Internet</a>, and <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/basic-web-pages/">Interneting is Hard.</a><br>
On a basic level, tags "nest" within other tags. Think of a Russian Nesting Doll for visual reference. They close around each other, depending on what they do and how important they are.<br>
For instance, the paragraph tag <code>P</code> goes within the body tag, <code>body</code>. Tags start within two carrots, and terminate within the same two carrots with a backslash appended to the front of the tag.<br>
Paragraph tags display all the text within them, allowing for formatting with various other tags. They can also be broken up with <code>br</code> which doesn't need to be terminated. <br>
<code>a</code> is a tag used to define a link. Within the brackets for the first <code>a</code> you have the attribute <code>href=</code> with the link following in quotation marks. <br>
 The first snippet uses three other attributes, <code>id</code>, <code>class</code>, and <code>target</code>. ID is set to "the-best-link" in this case. IDs are used to define distinguish elements and style them. <br>
 Next, you have class. In this case, class is set to "banana" Class is used to specify a class for an element, which can be shared. Classes are typically defined in a .CSS document. <br>
 Finally, we have target. Target is set to "_blank". Target is used to define where the link opens. In this case, "_blank" opens the link in a new tab.<br>
